The Bit Balancer is a digital circuit designed to balance (or adjust) the number of 1s and 0s in a given binary input, ensuring balanced output suitable for applications like digital communications, error detection, and data encoding.

This repository contains:
1.SystemVerilog/Verilog design files
2.Testbenches to validate the design
3.Simulation scripts for tools like EDA Playground or ModelSim

Features
1.Takes an N-bit binary input.
2.Checks the number of 1s and 0s.
3.Adjusts or flags imbalance according to the specified balancing logic.
4.Generates balanced output or status signal.
5.Configurable bit width.
