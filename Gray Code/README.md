The Gray Code Converter is a digital circuit that converts between binary code and Gray code — a binary numeral system where two successive values differ by only one bit.
Gray code is widely used in:

1.Error‑resilient data transmission
2.Rotary encoders
3.Digital communication systems
4.FPGA & ASIC design

This repository contains:

1.SystemVerilog / Verilog design files
2.Testbenches to validate functionality
3.Instructions to run simulations and view waveforms
