The Rotator Unit is a combinational digital circuit designed to rotate (circular shift) the bits of an input word either to the left or to the right.
Rotators are used in:

1.Cryptography (e.g., hash functions)
2.Data manipulation and packing
3.Digital signal processing
4.ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units) and processors

This repository includes:
1.RTL design files (Verilog/SystemVerilog)
2.Testbenches for functional verification
3.Instructions to run simulations and view waveforms
