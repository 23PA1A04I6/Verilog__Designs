The Nibble Swapper is a simple yet useful digital circuit that swaps the higher nibble (4 bits) and lower nibble (4 bits) of an 8-bit input word.
Nibble swapping is commonly used in:

1.Data encoding/decoding
2.Byte manipulation
3.Communication protocols
4.Low-level data formatting tasks

This repository contains:

1.SystemVerilog/Verilog design files for the nibble swapper
2.A testbench to verify its functionality
3.Instructions to simulate the design and observe results
