The Sequence Checker is a digital circuit that detects a specific bit pattern in a serial input stream using a Finite State Machine (FSM).
Itâ€™s a classic project in digital design, useful for:

1.Protocol verification
2.Detecting control words or headers in data streams
3.Teaching FSM design (Mealy or Moore)

This repository contains:

1.RTL design files (Verilog/SystemVerilog)
2.Testbench to simulate and verify correct pattern detection
3.Instructions to run and view waveforms
